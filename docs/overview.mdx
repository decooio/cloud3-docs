## Introduction

**Cloud3** is a suite of featured products, tools and APIs to help build Web3.0 experiences, especially in decentralized storage area.

Underneath we store the data in [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech), the most widely adopted decentralized storage system in Web3.0 era. And moreover, we use [Crust Network](https://crust.network), the native incentive layer of IPFS, to provide **Guaranteed Storage** with multi-replica persistent and truly decentralization across the public IPFS network.  

## W3Bucket

**W3Bucket** is our answer to the simple question: what cloud storage should be like in Web3.0? 

All contents in W3Buckets are immutable, fully decentralized stored, and guaranteed of permanent persistence in the public IPFS network.

More importantly, each W3Bucket is minted as an NFT token, and bucket contents are fully and soly controlled by the NFT owner.

## W3Auth IPFS Remote Pinning Service

[IPFS Remote Pinning Service](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/work-with-pinning-services) is an open standard IPFS pinning service that allow users to pin their files to remote stable IPFS nodes or clusters.

**Cloud3** provides IPFS remote pinning services with standard [IPFS Pinning Service API](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec), with additional features like:
- Guaranteed decentralized storage with Crust Network
- Secured with [W3Auth Token](./w3auth)

## IPFS Scan

[IPFS Scan](https://ipfs-scan.io) is a free, handly and open IPFS explorer application.

Enter a file CID and search, IPFS Scan will show the CID's storage status and retrievablity from multiple reporting gateways.

## Toolkits

**Cloud3** also provides a set of toolkits to help achieve truly decentralized storage in various scenarios.
