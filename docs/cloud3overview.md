## Introduction  

[Cloud3](https://cloud3.cc) is a suite of featured products, tools and APIs to help build Web3.0 experiences, especially in decentralized data storage and data retrieval, in a user-friendly and developer-friendly way.

Cloud3 stores data on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech), the most widely adopted distributed file storage system in Web3. Moreover, Cloud3 leverage [Crust Network](https://crust.network), the native incentive layer of IPFS, to guarantee truly decentralized storage on IPFS with multi replicas and various durations. 

## A Web3 Cloud Service Initiative

Cloud3 defines what a Web3 cloud storage should be like:  
- Data storage should be decentralized, trustless, immutable and guaranteed.  
- Easily access with web3-style auth; no more usernames/passwords.  
- User rights/benefits are totally owned and controlled by the user.  
- Service and usage should be standardized, easily quantifiable & verifiable.  
- Offers developer-friendly, web3-native workflow.  
- Offers closed-loop Store+Retrieve services, both provided and guaranteed by decentralized protocols/networks.  
- All the data stored can be accessed by any third-party IPFS nodes/gateways.
